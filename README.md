# Deep Learning-Based Smart City Planner - Traffic Congestion

## 📌 Overview
This project aims to develop a deep learning-based approach to analyze and optimize urban traffic congestion. By leveraging real-time and historical traffic data, we build predictive models that assist in traffic flow optimization, congestion detection, and city planning.

Using deep learning techniques, this system can help city planners, transportation departments, and commuters make data-driven decisions to improve traffic efficiency and reduce delays.

## 📂 Repository Structure

### 📁 `code.ipynb`
- **Purpose:** Implements the deep learning model for traffic congestion prediction and analysis.
- **Key Steps:**
  - Loads and preprocesses traffic data.
  - Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns in congestion.
  - Trains deep learning models (e.g., CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs) for traffic prediction.
  - Evaluates model performance using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and accuracy.
  - Visualizes traffic trends and model predictions.

## 📊 Dataset Details
- **Source:** Traffic sensor data, GPS logs, or publicly available traffic datasets.
- **Structure:**
  - Features: Timestamp, road segment ID, vehicle count, speed, weather conditions, etc.
  - Labels: Congestion levels, traffic density, or delay times.
- **Size:** Varies based on data source and timeframe.
